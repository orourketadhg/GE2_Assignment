# GE2_Assignment - DOTS Space battle 

Name: Tadhg O'Rourke

Student Number: C17403574

Class Group: DT228

## Background

This project will utilise Unitys Data Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) to create a simulated space battle. This project will use several steering behaviours to control the movement of space ships in the battle. This project will use several additional DOTS technologies to improve performace, including DOTS Physics to simulate physics on the spaceship entities.

The project will have the ability to switch between several different camera viewpoints:
* Birds eye view
* panning view
* follow random ship
* free movement

## Story Board

This project will have several different spaceship models on each force. These ships have been split into different spaceship classes based on their size. the following legend shows their class relative to their size.

The simulation will start out in empty space with no life around. following this several different space ships from the allied forces, and the enemy forces will appear out of hyper space (via a space jump) to appear on the battle field. After a short amount of time, both forces will begin to engage in combat. The allied forces will have a more structured layout to their formation, while the enemy force will be more spread out.

As the battle occurs each space ship will be able locked onto a specfic target that they will have to destroy. when that target is destroyed they will find another spaceship to attack. The battle ends when one force loses all their ships. After this point the last ship(s) will space jump out of view, and the scene will reload starting again.
